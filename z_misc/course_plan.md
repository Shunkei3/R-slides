# Package:
+ Data analysis: `data.table`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`
+ Econometric analysis: `sandwich`, `plm`
+ 


# Plan: Overview
+ Day1: Introduction to R: Basic operation of R
  + To get familiar with the feature of RStudio (lecture 0)
  + To get familiar with the basic operation of R
  + To understand how to create vector, list, matrix, and data.frame in R, and how to access and modify the elements in those objects.
  + To get familiar with base R functions to do mathematical calculations.
  + To get familiar with be able to base plotting functions to visualize data.


+ Day2: Data warngling with `data.table`(and `dplyr` package)

# Plan: Day1

## To do:
  + Explore RStudio:
    + explain the layout of RStudio
    + explain the feature of R studio
    + code style
  + Types of R objects:
    + Basic element types
    + Basic object types
  + Basic operations of R:
    + Assigning values to variables: "Everything is an object and everything has a name."
    + Basic R calculations: +, -, *, /, ^, %%, %/%
    + Base R functions: log(), abs(), sqrt(), mean(), median(), max(), min(), lm()
    + plot(), density(), hist()

+ **Breife intoduction of Quarto and Rmarkdown?**

## Questions:
+ list vs 

## Base functions:
+ log(), abs(), sqrt(), mean(), median(), max(), min(), lm()
+ Data frames: like a matrix but can have columns with different types
  + Create a data frame: data.frame()
  + Check and convert: is.data.frame(), as.data.frame()
  + Transpose a data frame: t()
  + Subset a data frame: my_data[row, col], subset(), attach() and detach()
  + Extend a data frame: $, cbind(), rbind()
  + Calculations with numeric data frames: rowSums(), colSums(), rowMeans(), colMeans(), apply()


## Emphasis:
+ When you don't know 
+ Imagination of the process is important!
  + Suppose that you don't know the function `median()`, how do you calculate the median of a sequence of numbers?


## Exercise problem:
+ Generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100 increase by 
+ create a data.frame
  + change the value of the first row to 0
  + add column names
  + add row names
  + 
+ run the following code: `r <- sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE)`
  + find the value of mean and SD without using `mean()` and `sd()`
  + find the median value of `r`
  + Find the index of the maximum value of a vector `x`.
  + Exclue some elements from a vector `x`

  + select elements using "or" and "and" (e.g., %in%)
  + find the NA 
  + replace NA to 0


## A list of functions:
+ c()
+ seq()
+ rep()
+ sample()
+ head()
+ unique()
+ length()

# Plan: Day2 - Data warngling with `data.table`(and `dplyr` package)

# To do:
  + Piping operator with magrittr
  + To get familiar with the basic operation of `data.table` package
    + select columns
    + filter rows by conditions
    + define a new variable
    +

# Day4: Regression analysis and Report the 

# Plan: 

+ use `lm()` function


```{r}
library(wooldridge)
data(hprice2)
setDT(hprice2)

test <- lm(price ~ nox + rooms, data = hprice2)

coef(test)

```

# Plan: Day5

+ Monte Calro simulations: 

## Why?
+ "An estimator is a function of random variables and therefore itself a random variable. The properties of an estimator are fully described by its probability distribution (the so-called sampling distribution). The sampling distribution can then be used to perform tests against hypothesis"


+ Nibte Carlo Simulations: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.schmidheiny.name/teaching/montecarlo2up.pdf

+ Kennedy (2003, p. 24) defines a Monte Carlo study as “a simulation exercise designed to shed light on the small-sample properties of competing estimators for a given estimating problem.”
