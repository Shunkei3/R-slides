### Table of contents
+ Introduction 
+ Motivation
  + What you can do with R?

  + Basic knowledge about R and Rstudio (R 101)
+ Plan for this course


## About myself {.center}

+ **Shunkei Kakimoto**
  + Originally from Japan
  + 3rd year Ph.D. in Applied Economics (from this fall)
  + Area of interests: Environmental and Resource Economics, Water Economics, Groundwater Mangement, and Empirical analysis of climate change imapct on agriculture, grondwater management.
  + I was TA in Econometrics I and II (APEC 8211-12) and Micro Economics III and IV (APEC 8003-04)


## Current Research {.center}

+ Measurement Error Issues in Gridded Weather Data

# Motivation to learn R 

## What you can do with R? {.center}

+ Data Analysis (of course)
  + Data type: Tabular data, Spatial data
  + Regression analysis, spatial analysis, machine learning

+ Data Visualization
  + ggplot2
  + leaflet

Once you results, you can easily incorporate the results into your research paper or presentation slides.

+ Write an academic paper and make presentation slides
  + Qarto presentations
  + xaringan presentation with Rmarkdown
    + Dynamic documents


## How R is used in the course of APEC?{.center}

+ We use R in a serise of Econometric couses (APEC 8211-8214)

Specifically, 

+ To conduct regression analysis (e.g., OLS, IV, FE, etc.)
+ To conduct Monte Calro simulation to understand the property of the statistical tools
  + e.g., understand the difference in variance estimators in the presence of heteroskedasticity. 

+ Even if you are not familier or not confident in R, that's okay!
  + The required operation of R in these courses is not difficult.

## Objective of this course {.center}

The primary goals of this course is to provide you with the basic knowledge of R to conduct the following tasks:

::: {.callout-important title="Primary Goals"}
+ Understand the basic operation of data manupulation
  + e.g., selecting row and columns, creating new variables, reshaping data, merging two datasets.

+ Understand how to run regression analsysis and to create the regression table.

+ Understand how to run Monte Calro simulation using your own function and loops.

+ Understand the basic data visualization skill with ggplot2 package.
:::

That's it!!

::: {.notes}
+ These tasks might be too easy for some students, so I will provide some additional advanved topics for those students.
:::

## R and Rstudio {.center}

If you haven't done so, please install the following software:

+ Install R ([here](https://www.r-project.org/))
+ Install R studio ([here](https://posit.co/))

<br>

::: {.callout-tip title="What is R?"}
+ R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
+ has been and is evolving rapidly by the contributions of its users
  + state-of-the-art statistical methods (e.g., machine learning algorithms) written by the developers of the methods
  + geographic information system (GIS)
  + big data handling and analysis
:::

<br>

::: {.callout-tip title="What is Rstudio?"}
+ RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
+ by far the most popular graphic user interface of R.
:::

+ So, in summary, R is the programming language itself, while RStudio is the IDE that provides a more user-friendly and efficient environment for working with R.

::: {.notes}

+ R has a terrible graphic user interface. Rstudio, which is another application built on top of R, provides a more user-friendly and efficient environment for working with R.

## Course Details {.center}

| Day  | Topic  |
|--------|--------|
| Day1  | Introduction to R: Basic operation of R   |
| Day2   | Data warngling with `data.table`(and `dplyr` package)  |
| Day3 | Data visualization with ggplot2   |
| Day4 | Econometric analysis with R, and Monte Calro simulation  |
| Day5 | Write functions for more complicated Monte Carlo simulation
<!-- : Schedule {.striped .hover} -->

<br>

+ This is a tentative plan for this course. I am frexible to change the plan based on your needs and our progress.

<!-- + I use slides to proceed my lecture.
  + On the slides, we can run R codes and see the outputs.

+ After of the each chunk of the lecture, we will do exercise problems together. -->


::: {.notes}
+ These are the plans for this course. Since we only have 5 days, the topics that I can hand with is very limited. 
+ I will Focusing on the R skills that would be useful for your Eocnometric class. 
:::

## For Further Learning of R {.center}

If you want to learn more about R process (e.g., geospatial analysis) and Python, I recommend you to take the following courses:

+ R and Python, Programming for Econometrics (APEC8221) 

+ Big Data Methods in
Economics (APEC8222)
