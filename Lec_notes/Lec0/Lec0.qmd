## Outline {.center}

+ Introduction 
+ Motivation
  + What you can do with R?
  + How do we use R in course in APEC?
  + Basic knowledge about R and Rstudio (R 101)
+ Plan for this course

## About myself {.center}

+ **Shunkei Kakimoto**
  + from Japan
  + 3rd year Ph.D. in Applied Economics (from this fall)
  + Area of interests: Environmental and Resource Economics, Water Economics, Groundwater Management, and Empirical analysis of climate change impact on agricultural production.
  + I was TA in Econometrics I and II (APEC 8211-12) and Micro Economics III and IV (APEC 8003-04)


# Motivation to learn R 

## What is R? {.center}

It's a programming language that can be used for a wide range of tasks.

+ Data Manipulation: Cleaning, reshaping, merging datasets, etc.
+ Various Analysis: Descriptive analysis, regression analysis, GIS, spatial analysis, machine learning, etc.
+ Data visualization
+ Great tool to communicate your results with others.
  + You can write a research paper, presentation slides, and even a book with R. 

<br>

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.callout-note}
+ R is said to be slower programming language, but I don't think that's a general case. Some R packages (e.g., `data.table` for data wrangling, `sf` and `terra` for handling spatial data, etc.) are primarily written in other language such as C/C++ language, which makes their computation faster.
:::
:::



## So, How R is used in the course of APEC?{.center}

+ We use R in a series of Econometric courses (APEC 8211-8214)

Specifically, 

+ To conduct regression analysis (e.g., OLS, IV, FE, etc.)
+ To conduct Monte Carlo simulation.
  + e.g., understand the difference in variance inference techniques. 


::: {.callout-note}
## Don't worry!
+ Even if you are not familiar or not confident in R, that's okay! Basic knowledge of R is enough to conduct the tasks in the course.
:::

::: {.notes}
+ That being said, I received various requests from you guys about the R skills that you want to learn.
+ and, as my personal opinion, I want you to use R to aid your research and jobs in the future. 
+ So, I will provide a bit more in depth knowledge of R in this course.
:::

## Objective of this course {.center}

The primary goals of this course is to provide you with the basic knowledge of R to conduct the following tasks:

::: {.callout-important title="Primary Goals"}
1. to create and manipulate the base-R object data 
2. to do data manipulation with `data.table` package
3. to do data visualization with `ggplot2` package
4. to conduct regression analysis with `lm()` and make a publish-ready regression table with `modelsummary()` package
5. to write Monte code for Carlo simulations using `for loop` function. 
:::

+ I will also provide introduction to Rmarkdown and Quarto documents, to create a report with R codes and outputs.



::: {.notes}
+ These tasks might be too easy for some students, so I will provide some additional advanced topics for those students.
+ These are the plans for this course. Since we only have 5 days, the topics that I can hand with is very limited. 
+ I will Focusing on the R skills that would be useful for your Eocnometric class.

## Rstudio

<!-- start panel:Rstudio   --> 
:::{.panel-tabset}  
### What is it?

+ You can use [{{< fa brands r-project >}}]{style="color:steelblue"} app to write and run R codes, but it has a terrible graphic user interface.
+ [**Rstudio**]{style="color:steelblue"} is an another app build on top of R. It makes it much easier to edit R codes, see the results and organize the files. 
+ [But still, you need R to run Rstudio! R is the engine of Rstudio.]{style="color:red"}

+ R studio looks like this:

### Create New R code File

To create new R script file, click the `+` button on the top-left corner of the Rstudio, or hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `N` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `N` on mac).

To save the file, click the floppy disk icon {{< fa floppy-disk >}}, or `Ctrl` + `S` (`Cmd` + `S` on macOS).

### Change the theme (Optional)

You can change the appearance of Rstudio by going to `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Appearance` -> `Editor theme` and select your favorite theme.

### Multiple panes (Optional)

You can have multiple code panes in Rstudio. To create a new pane, go to `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Pane Layout` -> `Add Column`. In the same window, you can also change the layout of the panes.

In the following image, I have two source panes. Also, I changed the layout of the panes.

![](image/rstudio.png){width=60% fig-align=center}


### Command Palette (Optional)

Recent R-studio has a new feature called "Command Palette.". Hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` (`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on macOS) on your keyboard. (or go to `Tools` -> `Show Command Palette`). 

From the command palette, you can do anything!

+ create a new script file (R, Rmarkdown, Quarto etc.)
+ open an R script file from your folder. 
+ open R project. 
+ open new session .... etc.

## Summary: {.center}

+ Now you know how to use Rstudio. As long as you know how to create and save R script, you are ready to go for the next lecture.

+ You don't necessarily need to use R studio to use R (for example, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r){target="_blank"} to run R), but, Rstudio is a great starting point to get familiar with R.
